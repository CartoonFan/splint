Build Instructions
==================

To build LCLint you need:

   o a (hopefully ANSI-conforming) C compiler. On most modern Unix systems,
     cc will work fine. For older or less standard systems, gcc is
     recommended.
   o gmake, the GNU make utility. If you don't have gmake installed on your
     system, download it from prep.ai.mit.edu.
   o standard Unix tools: gzip, tar

1. Download the LCLint source package (lclint.src.tar.gz).

   Copy this package to the directory where you want to build LCLint.  When
   the tar file is extracted, it will create an lclint-2.5m subdirectory.

2. Uncompress the package:
      gzip -d lclint.src.tar.gz 

3. Extract files from the tar archive:
      tar xf lclint.src.tar

4. Run: configure
  
   This will create a Makefile with settings for your system. If you 
   want to install LCLint or associated libraries different
   directories, edit the Makefile.

5. Run: gmake

   It is best to do this in an emacs shell or a buffered terminal,
   so you can scroll through the output.

6. Set environment variables

   LARCH_PATH - path to search for lclint libraries and
   initializations files. If you are using the standard directories, this
   should be .:<base-directory>/lclint-2.5m/lib.

   LCLIMPORTDIR - directory containing lcl imports files. If you are using
   the standard directories, this is <base-directory>/lclint-2.5m/imports.

   Put the commands to set these variables (the actual commands will depend
   on the shell you are using) in one of your initialization dotfiles
   (usually ~/.environment). 

   Set up your PATH to include the directory containing
   lclint-2.5m/bin/lclint, or move the binary to a directory on
   your command path.

7. Run: gmake test

   Examine the test output. If there are errors, send a bug
   report to lclint-bug@cs.virginia.edu
