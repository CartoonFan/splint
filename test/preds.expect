preds.c:10:7: Test expression for if not bool, type int: *p
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
preds.c:15:8: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int): !(*p)
  The operand of a boolean operator is not a boolean. Use +ptrnegate to allow !
  to be used on pointers. (-boolops will suppress message)
preds.c:20:7: Test expression for if is assignment expression: b1 = b2
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will suppress
  message)
preds.c:25:7: Test expression for if not bool, type char: (c = 'a')
  Test expression type is not boolean. (-predboolothers will suppress message)
preds.c:30:7: Use of == with bool variables (risks inconsistency because of
                 multiple true values): b1 == b2
  Two bool values are compared directly using a C primitive. This may produce
  unexpected results since all non-zero values are considered TRUE, so
  different TRUE values may not be equal. The file bool.h (included in
  lclint/lib) provides bool_equal for safe bool comparisons. (-boolcompare will
  suppress message)
