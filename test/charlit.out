charlit.c:3:11: Variable x initialized to type char, expects int: 'a'
  A character constant is used as an int. Use +charintliteral to allow
  character constants to be used as ints.  (This is safe since the actual type
  of a char constant is int.)
charlit.c:6:7: Incompatible types for + (int, char): x + 'c'
Illegal instruction
