unsignedcompare.c: (in function test)
unsignedcompare.c:5:3: Assignment of ssize_t to unsigned long int:
                          res = read(fd, buffer, cnt)
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match long unsigned, use
  +longunsignedintegral.
unsignedcompare.c:7:7: Comparison of unsigned value involving zero: res <= 0
  An unsigned value is used in a comparison with zero in a way that is either a
  bug or confusing. (-unsignedcompare will suppress message)
unsignedcompare.c:12:7: Comparison of unsigned value involving zero: res < 0
unsignedcompare.c:12:18: Comparison of unsigned value involving zero: res >= 0
