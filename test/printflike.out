printflike.c:13:15: Traditional lint comment /*PRINTFLIKE*/ used.  This is
    interpreted by LCLint in the same way as most Unix lints, but it is
    preferable to replace it with either /*@printflike@*/, /*@scanflike@*/ or
    /*@messagelike@*/.
printflike.c:16:35: Multiple special function codes:
                       printflike, messagelike (first code is ignored)
printflike.c:17:5: Function qxprint is marked messagelike, but the argument
                      before the elipsis has type int (should be char *)
