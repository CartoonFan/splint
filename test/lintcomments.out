lintcomments.c:8:33: Traditional lint comment /*FALLTHROUGH*/ used.  This is

    preferable to replace it with the /*@fallthrough@*/ stylized comment
lintcomments.c:9:30: Traditional lint comment /*FALLTHRU*/ used.  This is
    interpreted by LCLint in the same way as most Unix lints, but it is
    preferable to replace it with the /*@fallthrough@*/ stylized comment
lintcomments.c:11:13: Fall through case (no preceeding break)
lintcomments.c:23:21: Traditional lint comment /*NOTREACHED*/ used.  This is
    interpreted by LCLint in the same way as most Unix lints, but it is
    preferable to replace it with the /*@notreached@*/ stylized comment.
